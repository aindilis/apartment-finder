Thank you tremendously for considering this problem and keeping an eye
out for possible apartments.

My ideal location has:

My price range is dependent on how many features the location has, but could be said to be
anything less than 900.  I would most like to pay around 600 or less.

Essential:

No roommates
Private bath
Quiet
Secluded and private
Considered safe
Large enough to build a "programming chamber"

Nonessential:

Near to work
Parking
In a location tolerant of people with Asperger's syndrome
Good access to the street for moving things in and out

Thanks,
Andy
