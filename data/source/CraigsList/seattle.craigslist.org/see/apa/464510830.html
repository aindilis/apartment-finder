SEWARD PARK / RAINIER BEACH beautifully remodeled 1 BR MIL (mother in law) apartment, located next to 100 year old house in process of remodel.  This One Bedroom with Kitchen has all the conveniences:
<br>

<br>
•	UTILITIES INCLUDED (full satellite/cable all channels, garbage, heat, water, sewage)
<br>
•	Complete separate private building
<br>

<br>

•	New sink in Bathroom and Kitchen
<br>
•	New crown moldings
<br>

<br>
•	Private entrance
<br>

<br>

The Kitchen is integrated into the living room.  So it is too small for a living area and will not fit a couch in there.  Take note that this space is not big enough for a large couch, it really is just a separate Kitchen that has space for a small table or desk, the dimensions are 10 X 12 with two walls containing cabinets.
<br>

<br>
We priced the area and know this is a very reasonable rate (below market value) for everything included here.  We want a responsible tenant that is respectful, conscientious and clean.  Homeowners are professional, stable, couple that is in process of remodeling the house bit by bit.  Rental to persons is solely at our discretion and background check ($20.00 app fee).  $915.00 / month, plus $500.00 deposit ($100.00 non-refundable for cleaning).
