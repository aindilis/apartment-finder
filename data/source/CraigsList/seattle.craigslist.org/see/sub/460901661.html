Mercer Island is an incorporated island community of 22,000. It is situated in Lake Washington, which forms the western border of the city of Seattle. The island is five miles long, and averages two miles across. Mercer Island retains a woodsy, rural feeling. It is connected by freeway with Seattle on the west and several small cities comprising Metro Seattle's Eastside. 
<br>

<br>
The Mercer Island Town Center contains businesses that provide services to residents. There are also some corporate entities, and a budding community of technology companies taking advantage ofa central location between Seattle, and the high-tech Eastside, where Microsoft has its corporate headquarters. Most residents work either in Seattle or the Eastside. Mercer Island is home to a high percentage of professional people and executives and CEOs of many of the leading companies in the region. Island residents regard their community as a tranquil place with lush vegetation and a rural feeling, despite its proximity to Seattle. It's also a well-to-do community. Mercer Island is home to many of the region's most prominent citizens. With 78 percent of the population holding college degrees, Islanders value education very highly. They take pride in their schools, volunteering and taxing themselves to ensure high quality. 
<br>

<br>
The home is convenient located approx. 1 mile from the newly re-designed Mercer island shopping district, both I-90 ramps (East & West), walking distance to Park&Ride and just a short drive (via bus, bike, or car) to downtown Seattle. The University of Washington, approx. 15 minutes away, is widely recognized as one of the best universities in the U.S.
