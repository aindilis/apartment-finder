Share a lovely 6000 sq ft mansion with in Madrona (close to Capitol Hill and Leschi), 10 minutes from downtown Seattle. The house is the size of 4-5 average sized homes! It is in a neighborhood of half million to million-dollar homes. You will be 5 minutes away from Lake Washington waterfront.  The place is available now.
<br>

<br>
Your Room.... 
<br>

<br>
Your room is a large pentagon-shaped room that gets lots of natural sunlight. It has classic hardwood floors and high ceilings. Just bring your suitcase! The room comes fully furnished with a beautiful princess bed and dressers ($2,000 worth of furniture). It also has a walk-in closet. 
<br>

<br>
Relax with the Amenities....it's All Included
<br>

<br>
Enjoy the luxuries of an entertainment room with a large-screen TV, DVD, and VCR. Watch what you'd like on Cable TV with over 100 channels. If you like movies, we have over 50 DVD movies. FREE DSL, laser printer, and phone access. I also have a fax machine that you're welcome to use. The kitchen is equipped with an automatic dishwasher. Everything is included, even toilet paper and laundry detergent. You can barbecue or relax in the cute landscaped yard. We have a fresh vegetable garden in the backyard. There is an outdoor deck you'll have access to on the 2nd floor. It has views of downtown Seattle. The kitchen has just been completely remodeled, so you will have a new kitchen to share!
<br>

<br>
Housecleaning Included
<br>

<br>
We have maids who come once a month and a maintenance person who helps with repairs. You will be responsible for picking up after yourself & doing weekly cleaning of one room.  
<br>

<br>

Madrona is an older neighborhood with charm, 10 minutes away from downtown Seattle. There are many million-dollar homes in the neighborhood. Tennis courts, library, shops, and restaurants, and King County Metro's bus line are within 2 blocks. Grocery store, post office, bank, and pharmacy within 5 blocks. Lake Washington is 7 blocks away. If you have a car, you can easily find parking on the street or in the parking lot of a school. The school is very generous to allow us to park there. 
<br>

<br>
You Can Have It All! 
<br>

<br>
You will have roommates.  You can socialize as little or as much as you want. Everyone is down-to-earth and gets along well. The house is so big that you can do your own thing if you choose, or find someone to socialize with. I like having my own space and was worried about that before I moved in. I have had no problems at all. 
<br>

<br>
I love my room but have to give it up for a few months while I travel. I am looking for a career-minded female in her 20s to sublet my room for 6 mo (now-April or possibly thru end of July). No smoking, no drugs.
<br>

<br>
This room is perfect for someone in town for a short period of time, in transit between living situations, or new in town.  
<br>

<br>
Housing is provided under special wishes of the owner's father. He had wanted to offer an inexpensive, great place for young career-minded women to live in. Rooms are offered under a special non-profit situation and are not subject to landlord-tenant laws. Therefore the owners are specific in the profile of women they wish to live there. 
<br>

<br>
This place won't last long! There are no better deals in Seattle! Call me at (206)219-9167 or email me at address above. Photos available upon request. I have subletted the room several times in the past and it was snatched up in 2 days. Be the first to settle your living situation before the room goes! 
<br>

<br>
Close to Lake Washington and Capitol Hill in Seattle.
