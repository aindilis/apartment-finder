This is an amazing 4 bedroom 2 bath house, we're looking for a roommate/subleter, and are totally flexibile on the terms of the lease (1 month to a year), and you can move in whenever.   Basically, this house just isn't getting used enough with only two people, so we'd like to open it up to one or two awesome roommates.<br>
 <br>
The place is located in Ravenna, literally one block from a bus stop with express lines (72,73, 373 which goes straight to the UW HUB, amoung a few others) it has a backyard, hottub, and fireplace.   If you don't have furnishings A bed and desk in either room is optional.  <br>
 <br>
I share the house with a good friend of mine, a guy finishing up his last year at UW.  He's a great guy, very into art and movies, has worked on several films, always has good music I've never heard of.   I love my job (male, 21), do marketing and business development, outdoorsy, go hiking once a week (as a rule).  I'm also extremely political (liberal), I'm working on several interesting projects I'd love to tell you all about. However, almost none of my close friends are politically active, so I can definitely carry on a conversation/get along with someone who doesn't care what bill is before congress at any given moment. <br>
 <br>
We're social, and like having people over (so you should be ok with that), but a crowd of 6-12 playing cranium and drinking cheap wine is more our speed than a kegger.   We are all clean and considerate of other people's needs.  <br>
 <br>
You can look at the house here <a href="http://6817seattle.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://6817seattle.blogspot.com/</a> However, those pictures are the furnishings from the last tenants (also the landlords, and the wife was an interior decorator) so the place isn't quite as nicely furnished.   You'd have the second bedroom downstairs (tv room) and the downstairs bathroom pretty much all to yourself.  Also, we'd be open to renting out the second main level room if If your interested. <br>
