We are a semi-retired couple in our fifties who are seeking house sitting opportunities in the Bainbridge Island neighborhood of Washington State. Last year we sold our home in Santa Fe, NM and after a temporary employment opportunity in Utah, we are ready to relocate to the Northwest. Finding an opportunity to house sit for 3-6 months in, or near, a community where we would like to live is important as we make a final decision. We want this experience to be a win-win for both parties.<br>
<br>
Both of us are college educated, management professionals. Currently we spend our time managing our investments, hiking, working out at the gym and playing tennis. We have high standards, solid work ethics, are extremely trustworthy and believe in strict confidentiality.<br>
<br>
As home owners over the past 30 years, we know the importance of house maintenance and, having built our passive solar home in Santa Fe, we understand the details of taking care of a house and knowing how to deal with maintenance situations. We are both relatively handy (outside of major plumbing or electrical work) and pride ourselves in keeping a house and garden in superb condition. We tend to leave our vacation spaces in better condition than when we arrived and would do so with a home we were house sitting. We have respect for other people’s property and furnishings. Both of us require orderliness and cleanliness in our day-to-day environment.<br>
<br>
We have a six year old, well-behaved Golden Retriever, Jack, who would accompany us to a house sitting situation. He is extremely well-mannered and is not allowed on any furniture, nor is he aggressive in any way to people or other animals. He can be relegated to a certain part of a house should that be a request by a home owner. Jack prefers to be outside on most occasions as there is more interesting viewing.<br>
<br>
We have our own vehicle, computers and phones. High speed Internet availability is preferred.<br>
<br>
We have house sat for a couple who owned three cats, fish and a parrot. We love animals (domestic and wild) and treat them as part of the family (As Jack can attest.)<br>
<br>
If you know of a client or friend that is seeking a house sitting couple, please contact us for additional information and to answer any questions. We have references and are available around March 1st, 2007. Thank you for your consideration!<br>
