I'm still looking for a nice and respectful person who is open and kind at heart who would like to share, a new apt that i have just moved into.
<br>
All new appliances, paint, carpets and ceiling fans.
<br>

<br>
All new kitchen stove and frig with new sink, and bathroom is all new as well..
<br>

<br>
I'm 46, white and felmale.I work a full-time job, I'm laid back and a very casual person , who is in search of male/felmale to start a new aptment with..
<br>
The bedroom is 10 by 15 with new paint, carpet, and ceiling fan. with a closet and another closet to split with me,,
<br>

<br>
I have a bird and no other pets allowed unless you have a bird as well.
<br>

<br>
Rent is 500 each with the utilities seperate, gas to heat and electric..
<br>
I figure around 600.oo apiece 
<br>
There is a laundry mat close, but we try to have an apartment sized washer and dryer soon.  as well as tony's groceries, banks, Mcdonalds, subway, leonias. blue line 10 minutes away. irving park bus 2 minutes away.
<br>
There is a roof top outside the back door and we can make it really cool, for spring and summer..
<br>
I smoke casually and drink casually as well, I do not mind if you do you as long as you are respectful, I'm clean organized except for many my dresser, love to cook and grow plants, and read and play cards with my friends..
<br>
If, you are interested call and set up a time to view apt and yes you would need your own furniture for the room and since the living room and dining are large you can incorporate yours and my together, I'm on the the ecectic side with likng old things..
