Here's the deal: I just moved to Chicago in August with a friend, but after a month, she decided she didn't like it here and moved back to Ohio. I need to sublet her room for November 1st. 
<br>

<br>
The Apartment: It is a small two bedroom for $1050 a month (so $525 a person). It is located on the border of Lakeview and Uptown (Broadway and Clarendon), just one and a half blocks from the Sheridan stop, and only two blocks from the lake. Heat is included. Utilities would be split, and they will average around $60-70 a month for phone, internet, cable, electric. The apartment is basically fully furnished, except for your room. The building has an elevator, so it should be an easy move to boot! The room is available November 1st, and the lease ends July 31st. You would need to pay a deposit of $550 to the landlord and pass the background check that they do. 
<br>

<br>
Me: I am a 23 year old female graduate student at DePaul and work at Starbucks (unlimited supply of coffee and tea for the apartment!), so I am fairy busy. However, I do like to go out, party, cut a rug or two, have a drink or three, when I find the time between work and school. I like to de-stress by cooking or riding about town on my pink cruiser. I'm also very much into music, mainly of the indie genre, but I won't deny my Prince, Dio, and ODB. I am pretty tidy, but not anal about it. I also have an adorable cat named Biscuit (she loves people but is a bitch to other cats, so sorry no pets). 420 friendly
<br>

<br>
You: Since the apartment is fairly small, I would prefer  someone who shares the same interests, so we can get along and hopefully become friends. You should be a student or have a job, and be financially secure and responsible enough to pay your share of the rent and utilities of course. I would prefer someone between the ages of 21-27. I have had males roommates in the past, which were completely awesome, but am open to females as well. If you like cats, indie, and biking, then JAM! Contact me!
