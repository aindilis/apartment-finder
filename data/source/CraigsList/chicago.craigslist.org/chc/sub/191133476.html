<br>
I have a furnished room in a three bedroom apartment available from Aug 11th through Sep 8th.<br>
You'll share with two white males in their late 20's. This neighbourhood is really nice, safe and there's everything near.<br>
<br>
Price:<br>
$280 for the entire period offered or less. Also a $150 deposit will be charged and given back to you when you leave. Utilities are included. We don't have central air. You're welcome to bring your window unit or enjoy the one in the living room.<br>
<br>
Transportation: <br>
Blue line stops Damen or Ashland 8 blocks away. Western bus can drop you at Western stop in 5 minutes, or you can take Division bus to Ashland - 5 minutes. Bus stops are around the corner. Parking available with a permit.<br>
<br>
Features: <br>
The bedroom has a single bed, a dresser and a night stand. There's a closet in the room. The apartment has one bathroom, high ceilings, wood columns, old school chandelier, hard wood floors, a big balcony - second floor - and a big kitchen. It's one of those Ukranian Village old apartments with big sized windows.<br>
<br>
Rules of the House:<br>
I'm leaving on Aug 10th so I don't know if I'm going to be able to meet you before I go. Anyways, you'll be sharing the place with two nice laid back guys. They're usually busy so you don't get to see them much. The apartment is kept clean. You don't have to split the house tasks but you must clean your dishes and clean your mess. No pets or smoking in the house, there's a balcony where you can puff. No parties unless agreed with the other roommates. After all, they are the ones you will be dealing with everyday. You just need to be reasonable to make this work. Male roommate is preferred because this isn't a fancy place. Enjoy our second hand furniture and the view to Thomas street. That is, for a month.<br>
<br>
Time Line:<br>
Please, remember the sooner we get this done the better. I won't go cheaper than what I'm asking for, and it's not interesting for me to sublet my room for a week for 100. Stay for as long as you want to within this time offer. It would be nice if you could come by to see the place before Wednesday. I'm leaving my phone # so questions can be answered right away. Let me know, I have free time 'til Thursday morning.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
<br>
