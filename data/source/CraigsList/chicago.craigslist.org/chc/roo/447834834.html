Just fund out that Bill, my current roommate, got a job transfer. His is moving out before the 15th, so I need to find someone. Awesome Location (Google Barry and Pine Groove), off Broadway between Diversey and Belmont. Express bus Downtown stops right by the building (151, 156, 134) just one block away there is 135, 145, 146 on Belmont and LSD. If you need a train there is Belmont and Wellington El stops within 5 min walk. Tons of bars and night life just steps away. 
<br>

<br>
You will get your own room, with large closet space, large window and air conditioner (not that you need it now, but still nice). Share bathroom and the kitchen with me and my cat Buster. Living room is divided into two areas my office/bedroom and living area. Fully furnished, including leather sofas, massage chairs, TV etc.
<br>

<br>
 The building has indoor pool and sauna, 2 laundry rooms, bike and storage room, parking if you need it ($125 + 1 month security), roof top deck, intercom and all the usual stuff. As far as utilities, you pay just half electricity. 
<br>

<br>
This place is perfect for someone who spends more time out, rather than in. It is NOT big by any means, but my last two roommates loved it. Now, I'm 30ish white male of European descent.....I just got my series 3 license as a commodity broker and spend most of the time at work trying to build up my business, so you have plenty of time for yourself. I do not smoke (I love it, but this shit will kill me, literally, so no smoking in the house, unless of cause it is not a nicotine.....in that case it's OK), I have a big, fat, lazy spoiled cat, named Buster.....so, if you allergic to cats, it might not work out.....I know I keep forgetting something, but if you have any questions, go ahead and ask anything. 
<br>

<br>
One more thing....I need someone ASAP, and from my previous experience with Craigslist, I know it wont take long to find someone. So, if you interested, call me, cause it might not be there next week.....oh, yes, one more thing. The rent is $470 a months and 1/2 of electric bill, but I will also need one month deposit....and at least 6 months commitment. I don't care if you black or white, girl or guy, straight or gay....as long as you cool, employed and be able to pay on time.
