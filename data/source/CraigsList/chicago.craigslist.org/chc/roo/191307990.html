<br>
Apologies in advance for the length, but I much prefer thoroughness and detail myself…<br>
<br>
We’re two friendly females in our late and early twenties looking for two others (male or female) to rent out two bedrooms in our sunny (4th/ top floor) Pilsen loft space, centrally located on the corner of 18th and Racine. The apartment is easily accessible via public transportation—[train: Blue Line/ new Pink Line (at 18th & Paulina); busses: 18th Street (right outside the door), Blue Island (which goes downtown), and we’re also between the Halsted, and the Ashland busses]. If you drive, we’re right off the 18th street exit off of the Dan Ryan…and 290, Congress/ Downtown are only minutes away.<br>
<br>
We’re surrounded by incredible Mexican cuisine, as well as being fortunate enough to have the new Maxwell Street dining corridor, Chinatown and Greektown right around the corner from us…and not to mention both the ethnic and large chain groceries all around. You’ll also find we’re in the middle of the famous Pilsen Arts District, surrounded by galleries, one of which is directly across the street; cafes, and neighborhood bars are plentiful. This is a beautiful Latin neighborhood engulfed with culture, artists, students, professionals, and families overseeing much development, as well as keeping its cultural distinction. <br>
<br>
The space is ideal for artists, possibly musicians, UIC students (being only a few blocks down from the school, as well as being fairly close to IIT), and professionals alike. We are an eclectic building with tenants mostly in their twenties and thirties, as well as a very friendly landlady and her family. We have an incredible view of the Downtown cityscape, especially standing from outside on the fire escape.<br>
<br>
There’s also plenty of storage space for bike riders, as the storage area houses a washer and dryer for our use—(there’s also a laundromat down the street). The building itself consists of four units, three of which are large loft spaces. Our space was formerly a dance studio, so there's some interesting history (as well as presence) in the building.<br>
<br>
We’re looking for (financially) responsible, cool, positive, upbeat, fairly laid back people who are clean, and will be respectful of the other roommates, who will equally pitch in when it comes to cleaning and shared supplies, such as toilet paper, dishwashing liquid, etc. There will be parties and gatherings/ social events held here (only on weekends, or as mutually agreed), though the space will *absolutely not* be treated as party central, and of course nothing “out of control”. We love to have a good time, but are also looking for those who are past the “…must party…” stage of life. I, personally, have to work very early in the morning, and treasure my sleep.<br>
<br>
Hopefully we can all create a positive and lasting impression on this space, as it has lots of potential, both esthetically and through the utilization of the space in (an occasional) social context.<br>
<br>
Both leases start September 1st, though one room will be available the 15th of this month, if desired. Rent will be $500/ month, plus one month’s worth security deposit. Water is free. Electricity and the phone/ internet bill have always been low for us, split equally. This is for a 6-month lease. Furthermore, the landlady is fairly flexible if you decide this is not the space for you, only as long as you supply a minimum full two-month notice of your departure of the space.<br>
<br>
<br>
Contact Christine at 312.829.3774 to view the apartment. Feel free to email me with any questions.<br>
