1 Room in the first floor of our house/apartment is available. It is available 9/1/06.  Rent is $430 a month not including utilities.  The house is located near the intersection of Irving pk. And Western ave. in North Center by the River. <br>
-Friendly, safe neighborhood lots of kids and families.  <br>

<br>
This house is full of creative type people. We have all (upstairs and downstairs apartment) grown to get along very well and are all good friends.  My last two roommates were classical musicians and things worked out very well, lots of hours of practicing going on and no body minding all the noise. So if you are a classical musician that is a plus but definitely not required.  If you are looking for a quiet place this is not the place for you. Although there are many times when it is quiet, I do practice drums just about every day, some days a lot, 2 or more hours. If you play a musical instrument you are welcome to practice here as much as you like. I also teach private lessons out of the house on occasion. One of my former roommates did as well.  Age range is of current tenants is early 20s to early 30s. There are 2 cats upstairs and I have a pet snake downstairs.<br>
<br>
We are looking for someone who is courteous and kind to others, and responsible, i.e. paying bills on time, and picking up after yourself in the kitchen and the bathroom, also someone who is used to living with other people. Most of all someone who would fit in and get along well with everyone else that is here. <br>
<br>
There is Absolutely NO SMOKING INSIDE THE HOUSE. Out side is fine if you are a smoker.  Please no Alcoholics/excessive drinkers/excessive partiers, No Drugs Period. Rooms are open to Males or Females Gay or Straight. <br>
<br>
Note that this offer is for no less than a 1 YEAR LEASE. <br>
<br>
Landlords are awesome. They are more like friends to us and are very timely and responsible about taking great care of the place. <br>
