Lincoln Square north; Great neighborhood, really big apartment; i'm friendly, i read a lot, play guitar and sing, record music, surf myspace and the net; i'm a non-intrusive, you do your thing, i'll do my thing, kinda guy.. friendly and chill. smoker friendly.
<br>
<br>
This place is the perfect winter home; cable, wifi, high speed Internet, phone, fake fireplace!  yes, it's true.
<br>
<br>
<br>
oh yeah...  my radiators just kicked on today in my apartment;  "ahhhh, the sound, warmth and feel of free heat"  how ya like that idea?  you got it. 
<br>
<br>
 read more...
<br>
I'm looking for:
<br>
A cool, responsible, full-time working, professional type guy or gal, or responsible student to rent 1 bedroom in my 3 1/2 br vintage apt., in north Lincoln Square. If you're an artist in some way, all the better.
<br>
No slackers, hard druggies or crazies please...  references required; work, current landlord, personal.   i drink casual and smoke ciggies and that's about it...  :)
<br>
$500 per month rent, and $500 security deposit plus we split the electric bill; your share of cable would be $15 per month. month to month room rental; it's my apartment, so you rent from me. 
 <br>
You can also share the rest of the common rooms in the apartment. The apartment is really big! new windows, radiator heat, no heating gas bills. high ceilings, plenty of closet space, hardwood floors, beautiful tree-lined views from the 3rd floor. laundry in basement. huge yard (sorry, no dogs)
<br>
<br>
<br>
It's a 4 unit building; Nice neighbors, friendly. Landlord on premises. I have the 3rd flr unit; 
<br>
<br>
You get: 1 bedroom appr: 12x10, with a closet. it's right next to the bathroom. and i just checked; your radiator cranks!  nice to know for them winter months ahead...  your room is painted goldish yellow and eggplant, but you can paint it any color you want...  cool?
  
<br>
<br>
NOTE:  There will actually be other rooms available, as my current roommate is moving out Nov. 1st; and i'm flexible to giving you more space if you need it. he has 1 1/2 brs in the back of the apt. 
<br>
You'll like this place so much, you should check it out. i have a really big living room, giant dining room too. lot's of empty space, in case you have a lot of stuff.  celing fans galore. newer kitchen, plenty of cupboards. bathroom is fine. enclosed back porch. a super giant side and back yard too...it's all good!
<br>
 The place is randomly decorated with 60s and 70s furniture, it's somewhat quichie.. I keep the place clean, but i'm not picky. 
<br>
Great neighborhood too~ 1 block from beautiful River Park; quiet, brick bungalo type of neighborhood, about 5 blocks nw of the main Lincoln Square business district. The brown line train stations and major bus routes are a few blocks away. No permit-street parking.
 
<br>
My current roommate is moving out at the end of this month, need someone one responsible and friendly soon. 
<br>

<br>
let me know if you want to see the place: it's available now-Nov. 1st.
<br>
