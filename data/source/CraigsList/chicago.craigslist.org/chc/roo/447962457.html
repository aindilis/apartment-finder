In need of some temporary housing while you get your life back together? 
<br>
I have 2 openings available at my home in Calumet City. 
<br>

<br>
Private room in a nice-sized, updated residence with others in Recovery. 
<br>
I've been sober for 4 years now, by becoming involved in a similar program 
<br>
when it seemed that there were no other choices available to me, and
<br>
nothing else worked.  Staying straight for any length of time was impossible.
<br>
Looking back, and although a difficult decision, it was the best move I ever made, in that respect. 
<br>
The Program involves pre-selected long and short-term goals outlined by the individual. 
<br>
We work together to help you reach those goals, as you become more comfortable in your own skin. 
<br>

<br>
In-house Meetings are available, as well as other good, local meetings nearby.
<br>

<br>
The $180/wk Program Fee includes: a clean warm bed and sheets/blanket/pillow, utilities, food <br>
and the support of those already in Recovery for those who Want To Be. 
<br>
There are also laundry facilities, Cable TV, and DSL Internet Access on-site. 
<br>
Claimed by many former residents to be "the Nicest recovery home they've ever been in"
<br>
<br>
Qualified applicants will have completed a 28-day inpatient program, or, 
<br>
who have been 'around the Program' for a while, and desire to live
<br>
with others who are willing to share experience, strength, and hope. 
<br>

If you think it's time for a change, because you just can't continue living 
<br>like you have been...you're probably right.
