<br>
We are two guys and a girl with a couple of funny-looking dogs who have a room to fill starting September 1 in a rather large 4 BR/2.5 BA duplex - lease until April 1 with the opportunity to renew. Details: <br>
<br>
--Located in North Center, which is where West Lakeview, Lincoln Square, Ravenswood, Roscoe Village and Wrigleyville all sort of meet <br>
--The room available is about 10x12' <br>
--We have somewhere around 2200-2500 sq. ft. of living space <br>
--Dining room is separate from the two living rooms, one with a fireplace and one with a 52" TV <br>
--DirecTV with Tivo. We're addicted. <br>
--Washer and dryer in our place, no coins <br>
--FREE wireless internet and telephone landline <br>
--We think garage parking is available for a fee, but there is unzoned street parking everywhere <br>
--90-second walk to the Irving Park brown line...which is about a five-minute ride to the Belmont station and about 20-25 minutes to the Loop <br>
--About a five-minute walk (or less) to Trader Joe's, Jewel-Osco (maybe 7-10 minutes depending on how long your legs are...mine are short), a couple dozen bars and restaurants, and a bowling alley <br>
<br>
Roommate #1 - 25-year-old girl who does some kind of marketing way out in the burbs, originally from upstate New York, loves the theatre and hates that none of us will go with her. <br>
<br>
Roommate #2 - 24-year-old guy from Florida who designs high-end web stuff for an ad agency downtown. Likes to ride his bike everywhere and has an unusually deep affinity for Uncle Julio's Hacienda (that is a Mexican restaurant, in case you are from out of town). <br>
<br>
Roommate #3 (me) - 27-year-old guy who moved here from Washington, DC. Part-time grad student and I work from home as a management consultant. I am the owner of the two dogs and my guilty pleasure is watching professional wrestling (but I don't make roommates watch it with me, I promise). <br>
<br>
We are seeking someone who will fit into the house and our lifestyle - go out for dinner or a drink after work, watch stupid TV together, take the dogs for a walk, spend four hours going to brunch and afterward driving to stores buying things we don't need on a Sunday afternoon, that kind of stuff. And we like to entertain - we're the ones people ask "what are you doing for..." the SuperBowl, 4th of July, Halloween, etc. We all have our own lives and things going on, but are more than just boarders in a house together. <br>
<br>
Ideally looking for someone who... <br>
--Has been out of college for at least a year - we wish recent grads all the best but are looking to avoid the discoveries and woes of a roommate's newly-ordained, post-collegiate life <br>
--Is preferably a 9-to-5er, or somewhere close to it <br>
--Has experience living with multiple roommates <br>
--Has experience living with dogs and loves them (not just a dog tolerator) <br>
--Is gainfully employed and will have no problem paying rent and bills on time (and can pass a credit check if necessary) <br>
--Can join our 2% milk co-op (this is not a dealbreaker) <br>
--Does not mind kicking in for house purchases or other things now and then to make the place look nice <br>
--Is not into smoking or drugs besides maybe caffeine and alcohol <br>
--Favors hole in the wall bars to places where you have to wear a shiny shirt, wait in line and pay a cover <br>
--Does not have grandma's raggedy old couch or the futon from college that we absolutely must find a place for in the house (we do have space for stuff that does not look like it should be donated to your favorite charity) <br>
--Has no extra baggage such as gun ownership, religious or political extremism, clinical depression, chronic or communicable disease, roommate skeletons in the closet <br>
<br>
If this sounds like your kind of place, let us know...
