Ok, I'm a TERRIBLE house keeper.  There is stuff everywhere.  But I've got an empty bedroom with a bath that would be yours 95% of the time, laundry in the home, wireless DSL, cable, air conditioning, new modern appliances in the kitchen, off-street parking, etc.<br>
<br>
Normally, a room in this location and of this quality would go for at least $500-600 a month plus your utility split.  But I'm willing to negotiate a decent reduction for your skills in keeping the place in order. I'm looking for someone who would clean the place up, and then keep me in line as far as clutter and such.  You'd also love my two small dogs, and sometimes walk and feed them if I work late.  A couple times a year, I might leave you with the dogs for a whole week.  I'm not looking for a full-time housekeeper, and after we get the place straightened up, it shouldn't be that hard.  It has just gotten away from me!<br>
<br>
Ok me, I'm a late-middle aged gay male.  I have lived alone way too long, and need some order in my life.  I lead a pretty low key lifestyle, though I work a lot and am often on the go when I should be home cleaning house, etc.  I have company rarely, and of course you could have company too, but I'm not looking to run grand central station.  I'm looking for a laidback and responsible person, no drugs, non-smoker.  The room is not suited to more than one person, please, I've had couples apply and that won't work. To be honest, I've had a couple of false starts for this arrangements with  younger gay males, and it was not a good experience.  My preference would be for a female, or a straight but friendly man beyond college age, but I'll consider anybody who takes the time to apply.  Send me some information about yourself and ask the questions that are on  your mind!  <table summary="craigslist hosted images">
