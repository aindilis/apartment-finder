We all know that buying property is increasingly more difficult these days – banks are just NOT giving away loans like they used to.  The rental market is picking up and I need a roommate ASAP…!!!!!!!!!!
<br>

<br>
I am female age 27.  I am looking for another female to rent my second bedroom at my condo in Woodridge (Woodridge drive and Hobson rd – main intersections).  I am asking to have credit check, criminal background check and current work/prior living arrangements will need to be investigated for all applicants.
<br>
 Cost will be $50.  move in date would be as early as novemeber 10th, 2007.
<br>

<br>
         No kids, and preferably between ages of 23 and 35.   
<br>

<br>
Condo is conveniently located near I-355.  Lots of shopping and work in the area.  The College of Dupage is just a short drive up RT. 53.  The Metra train station is Close too for trips to and from Chicago or if you are a commuter working in the loop.
<br>

<br>
Second floor unit (no windows on ground floor- safe..!!) - TWO bedroom - TWO full bath.  Galley style kitchen, dining room, living room and secured entryways.  Coin laundry on site.  If you own a vehicle there is parking available in the lot at no extra cost.  Master bedroom has its own full size bath.  Master bedroom rents at $800per month - if second bedroom is suitable enough it is only $600per month; plentiful storage and many closets.  Water and Heat are included so no extra utility bills..!!  You must be willing to split internet line, cable and electricity which are fairly cheap..!  
<br>

<br>
Where else can u go around here and beat these prices, have a grt roomy and be indepenadant while in a comfortable safe environment…? 
<br>

<br>
First month rent due upon occupancy.  One month rent due as security deposit and must be collected when signing the lease at some point prior to move in date.  the lease will be qrtrly or yrly and renewed when need be if u would like to stay.  more datils can be discussed if things progress.
<br>

<br>

ATTN to other LANDLORDS:  IMPORTANT...!!!

Taj P. Chapmon has been renting this condo from me since march 2007. Taj found our condo via craigslist and i would hate for anyone else to be falsified by his demeanor/character as he looks to rent again. he has failed to pay rent for 5 straight months (june thru oct)and owes a total of morethen $6000.!! we are in pursuit of eviction as we speak w/ the dupage county courts. all three credit bureaus will be notified after the eviction is final. Taj has written "NSF" (bad checks) twice since renting w/ us. this can be considered a felony charge. 

Taj is also a slob; allows his small dog to urinate and poop in the condo and its cage. has not cleaned any part of the condo in the 7 months he has rented - is this who you want in ure place..?? his referances all checked out as many probably do. all comments stated here are factual and true. 

I strongly urge anyone who crosses Taj P. Chapmons Path to think twice and wisely about renting to him. he will most likely try to rent using a friends name perhaps. make sure you get the names and drivers license of all ppl inquirring about renting your property and follow thru w/ a credit chk as he has had several others living in my condo (FOR 5 FREE months) besides himslef. 

who knows how long he has been pulling stunts like this; i would hate for it to happen to you. 

i didn't know where else to post this warning. i figured the rental/rooms for share section would be perfect. 

thank you, craigslist, and all its customers - good luck.<table summary="craigslist hosted images">
