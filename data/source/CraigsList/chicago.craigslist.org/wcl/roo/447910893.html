<br>
Are you looking for temporary housing?
<br>

<br>
I am looking for a female that is interested in renting a room in my townhouse for a short period of time, approximately 3 to 4 months.  Townhouse is located in Four Lakes Village.  There are many amenities that will be available to you; swimming, boating, tennis, volleyball and more.  The Surrounding area is very rustic, filled with many trees and lakes.  Great for walks and bicycling.
<br>

<br>
Close to major expressways but very setback so the atmosphere is country in appearance.  Very close to two great college schools, North Central College which is located in Naperville and Illinois Benedictine which is located in Lisle.
<br>
  
<br>
I am looking for an individual that respects anothers privacy, and prefers the quiet life.  I work a lot of hours and enjoy relaxing at home in the evenings and week-ends.  I am looking for someone who enjoys the same or at least is respective of it.  I am a smoker and have 2 cats.  I also am looking for a non-drinker.  You will have a room, plus full house priveledges.  Unfortunately there is probably no room for additional pets though. 
<br>

<br>
Willing to negotiate the length or term but am definitely only looking for a temporary tenant.  Will be flexible though based on needs.      
<br>

<br>
Asking $675.00 a month but will negotiate options.  Room / housing should be available 11/15/2007 or 12/01/2007.  Still working on clearing out room -but willing to show now.
<br>

<br>
Must be employed and willing to have credit check, and/or background check done.  If previously credit problems please be up front about it.  Will consider but will require payment upfront.   <table summary="craigslist hosted images">
