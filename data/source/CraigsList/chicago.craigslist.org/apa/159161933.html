<br><br>...I'm a Chi-town native myself (grew up right around Belmont and Broadway folks!), transplanted out here a few years ago and wondered why the loft scene in LA wasn't as exciting as it was in Chicago but that's all changed!<br>
<br>
Downtown is now a vibrant, fantastic community in which to live, work and play.  We've got Staples Center/Convention Center, Disney Hall, Little Tokyo, the Fashion District, the Financial District, great theaters, restaurants and more literally steps from our door.<br>
<br>
And did I mention that our building is the Historic Federal Reserve Building? It's a concrete monster and approved bomb shelter but it's also an architectural dream.  What exactly does that mean to you?  It means really beautiful lofts in a building where you can feel the history, and at the same time you can live in the heart of downtown but still find peace and quiet in your own sanctuary.<br>
<br>
The Reserve Lofts are now open for occupancy and going fast!  With polished concrete floors, gorgeous kitchens with stainless steel appliances, central ac, high speed Internet access, unique and wonderful attic space perfect for a sleeping loft or storage and downtown views to take your breath away...these are genuine New York style lofts.<br>
<br>
Building amenities that we feature; parking included, on site concierge, laundry facilties with tenant lounge, Fitness Center with state of the art equipment (I used to be a trainer and this is the real deal), outdoor garden patio and spa/hot tub open 24/7, courtesy patrol and more.<br>
<br>
If you're headed West, brace yourself.  Apartment hunting out here is a whole different animal and having experienced that myself I work hard to make it a fun, exciting time for everyone.  If you want wall to wall carpet and picket fences this is not your scene...if you want city living with style and creativity then this should be your new home.<br>
<br>
Feel free to call or email...talking to people back home always gets my tail wagging and I really do love to help.  LA is like another planet...but we're all having fun over here!<br>
<br>
Leases start at $1595 and go up to $6695 (for the bling bling penthouses)<br>
<br>
I've got some rent specials going as well; sign by May 15th to move in by June 30th and we'll give you ONE MONTH FREE plus two free months of additional on site storage...how's that for a "welcome to the neighborhood"?<br>
