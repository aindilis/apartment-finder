I moved in with my mom to help her with bills, but she's moving again, and I'm done with the family fold thing. Gah! Anyhoo, before this debacle, I lived by myself 2 years in Chicago (after growing up there), then moved to Mt. Prospect and lived there by myself for another year. I work in Lake Zurich (3 years this October) and I want to be in between said suburban hellhole and Chicago (party party). <br>
<br>
I have 2 cats, I smoke a LOT, I usually don't drink much at home, and I don't have a lot of people over. Toeing the line of being a hermit. I like crafts like beadwork and crocheting. I love reading, music, and movies. If you buy the cable, I'll pitch in for the movie channels and be your best friend. :) Everything I have is pretty much hand-me-downs and knick-knacks, so nothing fancy. I love candles, insence(incense?), and frebreze is a frequent visitor. I'm not christian, I swear a lot, I'm messy, and I can't cook worth a damn. <br>
<br>
Looking for someone who isn't a complete slob, pays rent on time, doesn't steal, and isn't mean to my cats (you kick or smack, you die) <br>
<br>
P.s. I work monday to frieday, sometimes long hours, so I'm not home much during the week. I work in a factory, so I'm a hard worker, and the last thing I want to do is come home to a snob, snot, or complete ass. I'm goofy most of the time, sometimes sensitive. Barring any great friendship, your money would work for me. Cant' go back to school without it. Everything would be pretty much furnished (picture the second-hand couch- ahhhhh) except for your room. <br>
<br>
If you're interested, mail me back, and if you're reeeeally interested, we could talk on the phone or meet and see if we scare each other. Age, race, sex (or orientation of) does not matter. Just don't be a priss. (No more pets, unless they come in a cage and aren't big enough to eat my cats) Okay, just rambling now. Happy hunting!<table summary="craigslist hosted images">
