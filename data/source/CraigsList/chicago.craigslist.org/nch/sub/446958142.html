About my studio:
<br>
1. It's a clean, brand new unit - I'm the first person to live in it;
<br>
2. Hardwood floors;
<br>
3. Dishwasher (and gas stove/oven, fridge, built-in microwave);
<br>
4. Ceramic tiled bathroom (with full bathtub);
<br>
5. HUGE walk-in closet (or a TINY bedroom, which is how I use it with a twin-sized bed);
<br>
6. Ridiculously high ceilings (about 14 feet) with crown molding;
<br>
7. Tons of cabinet space;
<br>
8. Ceiling fan;
<br>
9. An actual kitchen island (no "breakfast bar" gimmick);
<br>
10. Has new, insulated windows;
<br>
11. The walls aren't painted "institutional white" or neon green (though the door could use some painting);<br>
12. It's in a building with a GLORIOUS view of the city skyline (though not from the apartment), a clever laundry facility (using cash cards instead of tons of quarters), a work-out room, and a bike room;
<br>
13. It's <b>$845/month with all utilities except electricity included. Heat IS included, as it's radiator heat. High-speed Internet and satellite TV is also included at no additional charge.</b>
<br>

<br>
My apartment is located in a building on a quiet, one-way, tree-lined street. Starbucks, Caribou, Einstein Bagels, The Lincoln Perk, The Bourgeois Pig, Chase, Subway, the 22 Clark bus, the 36 Broadway bus, the Brown and Red lines, etc., etc., are all very close by. The Lincoln Park Zoo and Lake Michigan are about a 10 minute walk east of my apartment. It's on the first floor and it faces north, so it stays cool in the summer (even without A/C) and out of the gale-force winds in the winter. Parking on the street is possible with a Zone 143 permit ($25/year). No security deposit needed. No pets permitted.
<br>

<br>
This studio isn't very big in terms of square footage, but what it does have is nice - and clean! The floor plan is not a standard studio "box;" it's more akin to a baby one-bedroom. My lease goes through June 30, 2008, and I would like to have someone move in for November 1. I can provide pictures soon; email with any questions and/or to see the place. I'll be showing the unit a few times this weekend: Saturday morning, late Saturday afternoon, and maybe Sunday (if needed).
<br><br>
Edit: I may have misinformed a few respondents to this ad. I was under the impression that the subleasee would be required to pay a $150 move-in fee as I did when I moved in, but that is not the case. A $50 fee applies for a credit check, but there are no other charges required for move-in (other than the first month's rent, received by the management company by November 1).
